# OSINT Map

https://map.malfrats.industries

## Notes
OSINT map focused on gathering information from free tools or resources. The intention is to help people find free OSINT resources. Some of the sites included might require registration or offer more data for $$$, but you should be able to get at least a portion of the available information for no cost.

This project is a fork of https://github.com/lockfale/OSINT-Framework, we forked it since links were outdated and there was no more content updates since 2 years.

This map was initially created with an information security point of view. Since then, the response from other fields and disciplines has been incredible. We would love to be able to include any other OSINT resources, especially from fields outside of infosec. Please let us know about anything that might be missing!

Please visit the framework at the link below and good hunting!
